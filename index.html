      <h2>Getting a pet for better mental health</h2>
      <p>
        As stated by <a href = "https://www.who.int/health-topics/mental-health#tab=tab_1">World Health Organisation</a>, there are many threats to mental health, such as economic and social inequalities, and more recently, the Covid-19 Pandemic. <br>
        Poor mental health can kill. This is seen by suicide being the fourth leading cause of death among 15- to 19-year-olds. <br>
        People with severe mental health conditions can die prematurely – as much as two decades early – due to preventable physical conditions. <br>
        Yet, there is still a considerable gap between people needing care and those with access to care. <br>
        As such, this website aims to promote owning a pet as a way to improve mental health, especially for those who are afraid of going for therapy due to its stigma.

      <h2>Getting a pet for elderly</h2>
      <p>
        Older people are especially vulnerable to loneliness and social isolation - and it can have a serious effect on health. <br>
        People can become socially isolated for a variety of reasons, such as getting older or weaker, no longer being the hub of their family, leaving the workplace, the deaths of spouses and friends, or through disability or illness. <br>
        In <a href = https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/allnews/media-releases/impact-of-loneliness-on-life-and-health-expectancy#:~:text=Nationally%20representative%20data%2C%20collected%20from,perceived%20themselves%20to%20be%20lonely.">Singapore</a> alone, data collected from more than 2,000 older Singapore citizens and permanent residents showed that a third (34 per cent) perceived themselves to be lonely. This proportion increased with age, from 32 per cent among those aged 60–69 years, to 40 per cent among those aged 80 and above.
