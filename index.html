        <h2>Getting a pet for better mental health</h2>
        <p>
          As stated by <a href = "https://www.who.int/health-topics/mental-health#tab=tab_1">World Health Organisation</a>, there are many threats to mental health, such as economic and social inequalities, and more recently, the Covid-19 Pandemic. <br>
          Poor mental health can kill. This is seen by suicide being the fourth leading cause of death among 15- to 19-year-olds. <br>
          People with severe mental health conditions can die prematurely – as much as two decades early – due to preventable physical conditions. <br>
          Yet, there is still a considerable gap between people needing care and those with access to care. <br>
          As such, this website aims to promote owning a pet as a way to improve mental health, especially for those who are afraid of going for therapy due to its stigma.

        <h3>Benefits</h3>
        <div id="benefits">
          <ol>
            <li>Playing with a dog or cat can elevate levels of serotonin and dopamine, which calm and relax.</li>
            <li>Providing companionship. Companionship can help prevent illness and even add years to your life, while isolation and loneliness can trigger symptoms of depression. Caring for an animal can help make you feel needed and wanted, and take the focus away from your problems, especially if you live alone. Most dog and cat owners talk to their pets, some even use them to work through their troubles. And nothing beats loneliness like coming home to a wagging tail or purring cat.</li>
            <li>Helping you meet new people. Pets can be a great social lubricant for their owners, helping you start and maintain new friendships. Dog owners frequently stop and talk to each other on walks, hikes, or in a dog park. Pet owners also meet new people in pet stores, clubs, and training classes.</li>
            <li>Reducing anxiety. The companionship of an animal can offer comfort, help ease anxiety, and build self-confidence for people anxious about going out into the world. Because pets tend to live in the moment—they don't worry about what happened yesterday or what might happen tomorrow—they can help you become more mindful and appreciate the joy of the present.</li>
            <li>Adding structure and routine to your day. Many pets, especially dogs, require a regular feeding and exercise schedule. Having a consistent routine keeps an animal balanced and calm—and it can work for you, too. No matter your mood—depressed, anxious, or stressed—one plaintive look from your pet and you’ll have to get out of bed to feed, exercise, and care for them.</li>
            <li>Increasing exercise. Taking a dog for a walk, hike, or run are fun and rewarding ways to fit healthy daily exercise into your schedule. Studies have shown that dog owners are far more likely to meet their daily exercise requirements—and exercising every day is great for the animal as well. It will deepen the connection between you, eradicate most behavior problems in dogs, and keep your pet fit and healthy.</li>
            <li>Providing sensory stress relief. Touch and movement are two healthy ways to quickly manage stress. Stroking a dog or cat can lower blood pressure and help you quickly feel calmer and less stressed.</li>

        <h2>Getting a pet for elderly</h2>
        <p>
          Older people are especially vulnerable to loneliness and social isolation - and it can have a serious effect on health. <br>
          People can become socially isolated for a variety of reasons, such as getting older or weaker, no longer being the hub of their family, leaving the workplace, the deaths of spouses and friends, or through disability or illness. <br>
          In <a href = https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/allnews/media-releases/impact-of-loneliness-on-life-and-health-expectancy#:~:text=Nationally%20representative%20data%2C%20collected%20from,perceived%20themselves%20to%20be%20lonely.">Singapore</a> alone, data collected from more than 2,000 older Singapore citizens and permanent residents showed that a third (34 per cent) perceived themselves to be lonely. This proportion increased with age, from 32 per cent among those aged 60–69 years, to 40 per cent among those aged 80 and above.

        <h3>Benefits</h3>
        <div id="benefits">
          <ol>
            <li>Find meaning and joy in life. As you age, you'll lose things that previously occupied your time and gave your life purpose. You may retire from your career or your children may move far away. Caring for a pet can bring pleasure and help boost your morale, optimism, and sense of self-worth. Choosing to adopt a pet from a shelter, especially an older pet, can add to your sense of fulfillment, knowing that you've provided a home to a pet that may otherwise have been euthanized.</li>
            <li>Stay connected. Maintaining a social network isn't always easy as you grow older. Retirement, illness, death, and relocation can take away close friends and family members. And making new friends can get harder. Pets, especially dogs, are a great way for older adults to spark up conversations and meet new people. It will reduce loneliness and isolation.</li>
            <li>Boost your vitality. You can overcome many of the physical challenges associated with aging by taking good care of yourself. Dogs and cats encourage playfulness, laughter, and exercise, which can help boost your immune system and increase your energy.</li>
            <li>Lower blood sugar, lower blood pressure, and better cardiovascular functioning are just a few senior health benefits of owning a pet. In addition, pet owners are even more likely to engage in healthier diets than others.</li>
            <li>Owning a pet improves memory recall, memory retention, and improved mental cognition in the owner.</li>

A <a href = "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5369070/">study published in The Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health</a> found evidence that children turn to their pets for comfort, reassurance, and emotional support.

Plus, pets are nonjudgmental and supportive, providing a safe space for children to express themselves.</p>

            <p><span>Pets of all different shapes and sizes are important for children to feel a sense of comfort and companionship, especially those struggling with emotional issues like anxiety and depression. Having a pet provides helpful coping skills for children by alleviating loneliness and isolation, and other emotions they are struggling with. A <a href = "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5369070/">study published in The Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health</a> found evidence that children turn to their pets for comfort, reassurance, and emotional support.

Sometimes children have trouble connecting with other children or even adults, which is why a family pet can be beneficial since they find it easier to bond with an animal. Plus, pets are nonjudgmental and supportive, providing a safe space for children to express themselves.</span></p>
            <p><span>Many children struggle with low self-esteem, which can lead to other issues. Fortunately, pets can help build a child’s confidence, which ultimately will make them happier. According to a <a href = http://www.pethealthcouncil.co.uk/images/file/Pets%20and%20Children%20-%20PHC.pdf">report from the Pet Health Council</a>, kids with pets have higher self-esteem and confidence because they talk to, or confide in, the animal in ways that they would not do with people. Interacting with pets in this way also gives kids a chance to practice social skills. Additionally, experts have found that children who own pets have better social interaction with their peers since a pet gives them something to talk about with other kids their age. The best time for a child to have a pet to help build self-esteem is under age six. Dogs and cats are considered to be the ideal types of pets to provide social support since they offer a greater level of interaction and reciprocation than other animals. </span></p>
            <p><span>Taking care of a pet also helps children develop empathy. Because kids are naturally focused on their own wants and needs, a pet that depends on them can have a huge impact on broadening their perspective on how to care for others. One thing you can do is ask your children to pay attention to your pet’s mood and observe if it seems sad or sick. This will teach them how to be sympathetic to others’ feelings and needs (both animals and humans). They can also use these skills to participate in volunteer projects to help animals, such as a local animal shelter, nature center, or zoo. </span></p>
            <p><span>Another incredible benefit of children being around a pet is that they can help prevent allergies and obesity. Pets are often to blame for allergies, but a <a href = "https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-017-0254-x">recent study conducted at the University of Alberta in Canada</a> revealed that exposure to furry pets at a young age can actually safeguard children against both allergies and obesity. This is possible because immunity builds up naturally as infants are exposed to the dirt and bacteria from the pet’s fur and paws, even if parents only had the pet while the mother was pregnant.</span></p>
            <p><span>Owning a pet also gives children a chance to learn how to be responsible. Simple tasks like walking the dog, cleaning up the birdcage, bathing or brushing a furry pet, or filling a food bowl can instill a sense of ownership and accomplishment in a child.</span></p>
